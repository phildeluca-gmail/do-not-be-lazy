    // WorkGiver_Grower keeps a shared mutable static, wantedPlantDef, that
    // is only ever set up inside that enumeration: WorkGiver_GrowerSow's
    // ExtraRequirements assigns it per zone/building, and the enumerator
    // nulls it out again after each one. JobOnCell only recomputes it
    // lazily, "if (wantedPlantDef == null)". Skip the enumeration and the
    // field just holds whatever the last caller - us, or any other pawn's
    // vanilla work scan running on the same tick - left in it. Two separate
    // things break, and both were reported from real play:
    //
    //   1. The stale def is baked into the job as plantDefToSow, and
    //      JobDriver_PlantSow's goto toil fails on
    //      !plantDefToSow.CanEverPlantAt(cell), so the job dies during the
    //      walk. That reads to SweepManager as a failed task and ends the
    //      whole sweep.
    //   2. Nothing in JobOnCell checks zone membership explicitly. The only
    //      gate is CalculateWantedPlantDef returning null for a cell with no
    //      growing zone and no plant-grower building - and that call sits
    //      inside the lazy branch. A stale non-null value skips the branch,
    //      so bare unzoned dirt passes straight through to a sow job.
    //
    // WorkGiver_GrowerHarvest doesn't have this problem: no ExtraRequirements
    // override, and it recomputes the wanted def per cell itself.
